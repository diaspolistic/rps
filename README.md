<!-- OVERVIEW -->
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors project. 
Only the Javascript part is programmed.
It took me time but it was worth it, I've learned a lot while doing this project, especially on functions scope and hoisting.

<!-- RULES -->
You can play up to 5 rounds of the game. 
Paper wins over Rock.
Rock wins over Scissors.
Scissors wins over Paper.
If the player or the computer has 3 points before the 5 rounds, the game will stop and a winner will be announced.
If at the end of the 5 rounds, the player or the computer has more points than this other, then a winner will be announced.
If at the end of the game there is a tie/draw, then the game will end.
In each case (winning, loosing, or draw at the end of the game), the player will be asked if he/she wants to play another game of Rock, Paper Scissor
